                <ul>
                    <li> On use of the pink potion a player health can reach below 0 <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;And when the user heals its self, the app grants the player money back<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;But when the user leaves the potion shops the player lose its stats <br>
                            This due to the app sees the player with less the 0 health </i></li>
                    <li>Npc`s that don`t exist in the database wil throw the player a error page <br>
                        <i>&nbsp; See Npc`s list below for which cause the error and they are marked with <br>
                            &nbsp; (Does not exist yet in the database)</i></li>
                    <li> The attack system currently holds a bug that crashes the website <br>
                        <i> Due to conditions in the combat system can occur that the system wil crash<br>
                            This wil happen on the next example -> Monster.Attack is the same as Player.Defense <br>
                            And Player.Attack is the same as Monster.Defence <br>
                            When this is shown in the stats please do not attack the monster <br>
                            The result can be lost stats or a crashed system

                    </li>
                    <li> Magical_attack increase on defence is not displayed <br>
                        <i> Due to this your defence can be bigger than you think <br>

                            This is a issue due to the fact that game will throw back a error <br>
                            Reason for this is that the player has no inventory and the game cant find something <br>
                            On a empty "array" or non existing inventory </i></li>
                    <li> The menu at the top screen is not visable or hides direct after toggle. <br>
                        <i>For some reason there is an issue with the nav menu. <br>
                        Due to a issue with in bootstrap 5 the menu keeps be hidden after collapsing <br>
                        So for now the nav menu wont be visable until further notice </i>
